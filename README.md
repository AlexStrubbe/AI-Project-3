Comparative Analysis of Search Algorithms on 8-Puzzle and 8-Queens Problems
===============================================

### Objective:
Generate numerous instances of 8-puzzle and 8-queens problems and solve them using hill climbing (steepest-ascent and first-choice variants), hill climbing with random restart, and simulated annealing. Assess the search cost and percentage of solved problems and graph these against the optimal solution cost. 

### Methodology:
1. **Problem Generation**:
   - Generate a large number of instances for both the 8-puzzle and 8-queens problems.
   
2. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Implement hill climbing (steepest-ascent and first-choice variants), hill climbing with random restart, and simulated annealing algorithms.
   
3. **Problem Solving**:
   - Apply the algorithms to solve the generated instances.
   
4. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Measure the search cost and percentage of solved problems for each algorithm.
   
5. **Graphical Analysis**:
   - Graph the search cost and percentage of solved problems against the optimal solution cost for insights.

### Results:
- Analyze the performance of each algorithm in terms of search cost and success rates.
- Comment on the effectiveness of hill climbing variants, hill climbing with random restart, and simulated annealing in solving the 8-puzzle and 8-queens problems.
- Provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each algorithm in combinatorial optimization.

### Conclusion:
This project aims to evaluate the efficacy of different search algorithms in solving the 8-puzzle and 8-queens problems. By assessing search cost and success rates and graphically analyzing results against optimal solutions, we aim to gain valuable insights into algorithmic performance in combinatorial optimization scenarios.
